Key Components

manifest.json: Defines the extension structure and permissions
content.js: Contains the main logic for the cat's behavior and animations
styles.css: Handles the visual styling and animations of the cat element
cat-sprite.png: The sprite sheet containing all cat animations
cat.png: The extension icon

Code Architecture
The extension uses the revealing module pattern to encapsulate the cat's functionality:
javascriptCopyconst CatCompanion = (function() {
  // Private variables and functions
  
  return {
    // Public API
    init: function() {
      // Initialization code
    }
  };
})();
This structure allows for easy expansion and maintenance of the codebase.
Customization
Developers can easily customize the cat's appearance and behavior by modifying the following:

STATES object in content.js to adjust animation speeds and frames
cat-sprite.png to change the cat's appearance (ensure to update SPRITE_WIDTH and SPRITE_HEIGHT if changed)
CSS variables (coming soon) for easy color scheme adjustments

Future Development

Implement user settings for customization
Add more interactive elements and mini-games
Develop a system for "feeding" and "caring" for the cat
Create additional animal companions
